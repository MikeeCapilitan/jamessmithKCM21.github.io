    <h2><span style="font-size: 40px">👨‍🏫</span> Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone.  I am James Montealegre.  I am a part-time teacher at KCM Academy.  I teach web development and computer systems serving in Senior High School.  I also teach Grade 10 students on the fundamentals of using Excel 2016.

  <div style="background-color: green; font-family: Arial; padding: 10px; color:#fff;">
    <h2><span style="font-size: 40px">🏫</span> 
      Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other track or strands?
    </h2>
    <p>
      My wife's colleague informed me that KCM is looking for teachers that will handle their ICT specialized subjects.  At first, I was a bit hesitant to apply since I do not have any teaching experience.  Then it occurred to me that I have other skills that will help me in a teaching career.  Some of my skills are facilitation,  recruitment, social media marketing, and my other tech skills.

    <h2><span style="font-size: 40px">👨🏼‍🎓</span> 
      To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing course? Yourself,
      family, friends, special someone etc. Why?
    </h2>

    <p>
      I am dedicating my teaching career to my students.  I hope that I may be able to share my knowledge not only on the subject that I am teaching but also the experiences in my journey.  I hope that in this academic year, we can create new and creative learning experiences that will give us a solid understanding of building websites.
